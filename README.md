>This repository was create to understand how a `python` file can be complied to generate an `.exe` file. ![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

## Build with

- Python

- Pip

- Pyinstaller

## Live Demo 

[Live Demo link]()

## Getting Started

This project was created with the purpose of `python` file for their subsequent transformation into executable files with the `.exe` extension.

## Prerequisites 

- Windows, Linux or Mac (operating system)
- Python
- Pip
- Py installer 

### Install

Download the code or copy the git repository to your computer and follow the next steps:

1. Install `python` in your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Depending on your operating system and the version of `python` you have installed, you may need to install `pip`. You can download it from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

3. After installing Python and pip, you should check if they are installed in your console or terminal, by executing the following command in your console or terminal:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  ```bash
  pip --version
  ```

4. If you have installed `python` and `pip` correctly, you should see the version of each one in your console or terminal.

5. Once the `Python` and `pip` installations have been verified, we proceed to install the python compiler `pyinstaller` using the command:

  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```

6. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that the installation was successful by executing the following command in your console or terminal:

  ```bash
  pyinstaller --version
  ```

7. If you have installed `pyinstaller` correctly, you should see the version of it in your console or terminal.

8. Then to compile the code we must execute the command:

  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile main.py
  ```
  ### Usage

Run the main.py file.

### Run tests

Linters errors
